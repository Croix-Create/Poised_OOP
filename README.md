### Poised_OOP

This was Croix-Create's first Java capstone project.

## Objectives

The purpose of this project was to teach Java familiarity. The task was to create two classes that will be used to create a project object as well as a person object.
After the claasses were created a porgram needed to be written that would capture the details needed to create a new project object, change the due date of the project,
change the total amount of the fee paid to date as well as update the contractor's details.

## The How

The codes starts of with using a scanner object to retrieve user inputs. These variables are saved as object attributes and are printed out to the user.
This process is repeated for the project object. Once the user has given all the inputs required a menu displaying 3 choices will appear.
The user can choose to update contractor details, update the due date of the project and update the fee amount paid to date.
All 3 choices call upon independent setMethods after a new variable containing the new information is created. The new variable e.g newEmail is then passed as an argument.
This updates the orginally stored value.
